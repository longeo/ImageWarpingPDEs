# ImageWarpingPDEs
Image warping is a branch of image processing that deals with the geometric transformation of digital images. Warping can be used for creative purposes or for the correction of image distortion. Image processing software such as Photoshop, allows users to alter images by specifying a warp at a given point. However, this process may become arduous when the user is attempting to warp an image along a desired curve. The goal of this project is to create a method that will allow the user to warp e.g. shrink, stretch or pinch a specific part of an image along any specified spline while preserving the surrounding area. Ultimately this process will be applied to images of Classical Renaissance paintings with the goal of correcting perceived anatomical imperfections.
